git config --global user.name "Petter Ivarsson"


1- Create SSH key

if you don't have the ssh-key create it like this:

ssh-keygen -t rsa -b 4096 -C "youremail@example.com"

2- Check your SSH key

For this go to your folder ssh, example:

cd ~/.ssh

after that, run this command line : ls

if you have the files: id_rsa, id_rsa.pub so the all is good

now you need to copy your id_rsa.pub ! (⚠️ NOT the id_rsa) for this run cat id_rsa.pub and copy the result

3- Github / Gitlab

    Go to your github / gitlab.

    Follow the step by your hosting:

    github: Click on your profile -> Settings -> SSH and GPG Keys -> New SSH key
    gitlab: Click on your profile -> preferences -> SSH keys

    past your id_rsa.pub that you have already copied !

4- If you have already did it and it's already not working ??

When your enter your ssh-key in github / gitlab your key have a Expiration date so you just need to change it

That it ! Have a good work 😀
